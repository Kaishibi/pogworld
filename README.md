## Features:

## 1.16 and 1.15:
- Greatly enhances the amount of structures.
- The amount of strongholds are multiplied by 2.5. (128 x 2.5 = 320)
- Strongholds only contain the starter staircase 2 libraries, and the portal room.
- Shipwrecks are always the 3-chest variant.
- The amount of blacksmiths are increased. (It's basically guaranteed to have one in every village)
- Abandoned villages are removed.
- End towers are optimized to have the optimal height to perform a zero cycle.
- End tower cages are disabled.
- The chance of an eye generating in an end portal frame is raised.
- The area around the end spawn is removed (15 blocks in y, 4 in x), meaning cage spawns are removed.
